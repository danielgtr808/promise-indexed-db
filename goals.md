## \[x\] Get indexedb reference through promises
In this one, we must be able to get an indexeddb inside an async function and use "await".

Test suggestion:
    Check if the instance is indeed returned
    Check if the onupgradeneeded is called

## \[x\] Get data from a store through a promise

## \[x\] Delete data from a store through a promise

## \[x\] Wrap the "clear" method of a store through a promise

## \[x\] Implement the listener for changes on a "put" action
